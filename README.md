# `wsmc`
A total waste of your time

Allows players to connect to WebSocket wrapped connections and to host servers wrapped in WebSockets. It is possible
to pair this with a reverse proxy. `wss` is currently broken. Set the chunk distance to 1 or you'll probably time out
while connecting. Multiplayer ping list is also broken. Many things are broken.
